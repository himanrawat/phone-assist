## Architecture Principle: Provider Abstraction

Every external voice/telephony service is accessed through an **interface/adapter pattern**:

```
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│              Super Admin Panel               │
│   Telephony: Twilio (global default)          │
│   Toggle: Deepgram ↔ Groq Whisper           │
└──────────────────┬──────────────────────────┘
                   │
        ┌──────────▼──────────┐
        │  Provider Registry   │
        │  (config-driven)     │
        └──────────┬──────────┘
                   │
     ┌─────────────┼─────────────┐
     ▼             ▼             ▼
┌─────────┐  ┌─────────┐  ┌─────────┐
│Telephony│  │   STT   │  │   TTS   │
│Interface│  │Interface│  │Interface│
└────┬────┘  └────┬────┘  └────┬────┘
     │            │            │
  ┌──┴──┐     ┌──┴──┐      ┌──┴──┐
  │Twilio│    │Deep- │     │Groq   │
  └─────┘    │gram  │     │Orpheus│
             │Groq W│     └───────┘
              └─────┘
```

This is built in **Phase 1** and used by every subsequent phase.

## Key Architecture Decisions

1. **Provider abstraction from Day 1** — External services stay behind interfaces, with Twilio fixed for telephony and AI providers configurable per tenant or globally.
2. **Monolith-first** — All services in one Fastify server initially. Extract microservices only at scale triggers.
3. **PostgreSQL for everything** — Relational data + pgvector for RAG + RLS for tenant isolation. No separate vector DB needed.
4. **BullMQ for all async work** — Reminders, campaigns, post-call processing, notifications. One queue system.
5. **Streaming-first voice pipeline** — WebSocket audio streaming, not REST. Critical for <1.5s round-trip.
6. **RLS over application-level filtering** — Database enforces tenant isolation, not just application code.
